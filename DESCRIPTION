Description: BASS is a method for multi-scale and multi-sample analysis in
    spatial transcriptomics. BASS performs multi-scale transcriptomic
    analyses in the form of joint cell type clustering and spatial domain
    detection, with the two analytic tasks carried out simultaneously
    within a Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework. For both analyses,
    BASS properly accounts for the spatial correlation structure and
    seamlessly integrates gene expression information with spatial
    localization information to improve their performance. In addition,
    BASS is capable of multi-sample analysis that jointly models multiple
    tissue sections/samples, facilitating the integration of spatial
    transcriptomic data across tissue samples.
